# Contributing to Realistic Survival
This document outlines various ways how you can help contribute to Realistic Survival and make this a bigger and better project.<br>
All contributions must be inline with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [License](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/blob/master/LICENSE).
Please also follow the templates for Issues and Pull Requests we provide.

## :beetle: 1. Issues: Bug Reports
One of the foundations for good software is reliability. To facilitate this reliability, our community must work together to crush bugs that arise.
This of course requires good information and knowledge about ongoing bugs and issues though.

You can help this project by reporting a bug on our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/issues).<br>
Please adhere to the provided template and provide as much information as possible.
For more info on how to make good and helpful bug reports, check out our article on [How to report bugs](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).

If you encounter an issue which has already been reported, please don't open a new one.<br>
It would be awesome though if you could post a comment on the existing issue which explains how you were able to reproduce this yourself.
The more context and information we get, the easier we can fix it.

## :hammer_and_wrench: 2. Pull Requests: Bug Fixes
Bugs that have been reported need to be fixed of course.<br>
Any open Issue on our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/issues) is waiting to be fixed.

This is an Open-Source project and we love Pull Requests.
So if you have an idea on how to approach a known issue, feel free to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/pulls) which fixes this bug.
You can also comment on the existing Issue, proposing your idea or communicating that you wanna work on this.

## :wrench: 3. Pull Requests: Additions/Changes
Realistic Survival is an Open-Source project and anyone is allowed to make changes or add content to this plugin!

Please visit our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mMt3f4usqK) and share your ideas first, we hate to reject changes because the community disagrees.<br>
So communicating your intended changes before-hand will ensure that you don't put too much work into something that might get rejected.

We also have a suggestions section in our Discord Server too. Suggestions can be placed in the `#suggestions` channel and community members can vote on a suggestion.
Suggestions which gotten enough votes will be moved to `#approved`.
Therefore our `#approved` is a great place to start looking for ideas on what to add or change, since it will definitely be something a large number of people agree with.

## :scroll: 4. Pull Requests: Wiki contributions
Realistic Survival is a very large project and might be quite intimidating for new players.
That's why good documentation is always nice and helpful.
If you have played with Realistic Survival for a while and gotten yourself familiar with how things work, please consider contributing your experiences and knowledge to others via the wiki!
It would help out a lot :heart:
