 - Baubles
 - Spartan Weaponry
 - No Tree Punching
 - Waystones
 - Lycanite's Mobs

## üíª Download RLCraft
RLCraft requires your Minecraft server to be running on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or any
its forks like [Paper](https://papermc.io/) and [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/).

You can download stable builds RLCraft for free [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/rlcraft-1-17-baubles-dragons-sea-serpents.93795/).  
Alternatively, you can download development builds in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mMt3f4usqK). Development
builds are less stable but offer the newest features and improvements.

‚ùó It is recommended to use development builds since
they are the most recent version of Slimefun and also receive the most frequent updates!   
In fact, "stable" builds are so outdated that bug reports from them won't be accepted at all.

## üì∑ Screenshots
Here are some nice pictures of RLCraft. 
If you have some cool screenshots 
of RLCraft yourself, feel free to post them in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mMt3f4usqK), 
and I'll add them here.

## ‚ùó Disclaimers
RLCraft collects anonymous usage information through bStats. This info helps me to better
cater the plugin towards the community. If you do not want your server usage
information to be collected, set BStats to false in the config.yml file.

Because RLCraft is currently in its infancy, many features will be buggy and
not work properly. There is currently no support for protection plugins like GriefProtection
or WorldGuard. I am not responsible for any damage caused by RLCraft to your server.
