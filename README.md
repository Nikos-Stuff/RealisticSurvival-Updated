# Realistic Survival

This is an **unofficial fork** of the *Realistic Survival* project.  
The goal of this fork is to **patch and update** the plugin so it remains compatible with the **latest Minecraft versions** (e.g., **1.21.4** and **1.21.5**).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **temporary solution** â€” mainly intended for server owners who want to run the plugin on newer Minecraft versions while the original author is busy or hasn't updated yet.  
> Only minor compatibility patches and basic testing are done to ensure it works. No major changes are made to the original plugin's functionality.
