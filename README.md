# Realistic Survival – Updated

This is an **unofficial fork** of the *Realistic Survival* plugin.  
The goal of this fork is to **patch and update** the plugin to remain compatible with the **latest Minecraft versions** (e.g., **1.21.4** and **1.21.5**).

> [!NOTE] 
> This is a **temporary solution** primarily intended for server owners who want to run the plugin on newer Minecraft versions while the original author is unavailable or hasn't released updates yet.  
> Only **minor compatibility patches** and basic testing are done to ensure it works, with no major changes to the original plugin’s functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Version numbers will remain the same as the original (e.g., 1.2.9) to ensure no confusion when upgrading or migrating to official releases. This prevents any config issues.
