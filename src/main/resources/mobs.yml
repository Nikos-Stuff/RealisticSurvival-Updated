# Customize chance and loot tables of dragons, sea serpents, and withers

Dragons:
  # The vanilla ender dragon will randomly become either an fire, ice, or lightning dragon
  # Increase the chance of a dragon type to make that dragon more common
  # Make sure chances add up to 1.0
  FireDragon:
    Chance: 0.4
    # Chance the vanilla acid ball attack becomes a special attack instead
    # Make sure rates add up to 1.0
    BreathAttack:
      # LayerBlock - The block that replaces air
      # BurntBlock - The block which flammable blocks get turned into
      # CharredBlock - The block which nonflammable blocks get turned into
      # Blocks use the enum constant names here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
      # VelocityMultiplier - How much faster the flames travel compared to the speed of a normal acid ball
      # RadiusConstant - Helps determine the minimum radius of fire and charring
      # DecayTicks - Determines when the breath attack is removed due to having traveled too far
      # ImmuneBlocks - Specify which blocks are immune to breath attacks
      # Endstone, bedrock, and other blocks found in the end are put here to prevent the main end island from being destroyed
      # The following settings already work well for a good dragon fight
      # You don't need to change them in most cases
