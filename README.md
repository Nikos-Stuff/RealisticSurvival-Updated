Realistic Survival is a plugin inspired by RLCraft that aims to 
increase the difficulty of normal vanilla Minecraft.

The plugin is organized into several modules which can be configured at will: 
- Baubles
- Spartan Weaponry
- Spartan and Fire
- No Tree Punching
- Tough As Nails
- Ice and Fire

## ‚ùó Disclaimers
Realistic Survival collects anonymous usage information through bStats. This info helps me to better
cater the plugin towards the community. If you do not want your server usage
information to be collected, set BStats to false in the config.yml file.

Because Realistic Survival is currently in its infancy, many features will be buggy and
not work properly. There is currently no support for protection plugins like GriefProtection
or WorldGuard. I am not responsible for any damage caused by Realistic-Survival to your server.

Realistic Survival uses source textures and ideas from many mods.
